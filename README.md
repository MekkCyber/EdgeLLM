# EdgeLLM

This repository contains simple React Native applications that demonstrate how to deploy large language models on edge devices using llama.rn, a React Native wrapper for llama.cpp. For a detailed overview of the development process, please refer to the accompanying blog post [here](https://www.example.com).

## How to launch the apps

1. Clone the repository
2. Choose the app you want to launch (Basic or Plus) and open the folder in your terminal
3. Run `npm install` 
4. For Ios simulators, in the ios folder, run `pod install`
5. In the app folder, run `npm start` then on an other terminal, run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` (the emulator/simulator need to be setup before launching the app)
